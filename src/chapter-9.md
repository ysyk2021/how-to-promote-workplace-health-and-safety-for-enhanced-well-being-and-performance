Analyzing feedback and performance data is critical for understanding the effectiveness of workplace health and safety initiatives. Key performance indicators (KPIs) can be used to track progress toward specific goals, such as reducing incident rates or increasing employee participation in workplace health and safety initiatives.

Adjusting workplace health and safety strategies based on feedback is essential for improving workplace health and safety initiatives. By analyzing feedback and performance data, organizations can identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments to their workplace health and safety program.

Feedback can come from a variety of sources, including employee surveys, incident reports, and near-miss reporting. It is important to take this feedback seriously and use it to inform workplace health and safety strategies.
