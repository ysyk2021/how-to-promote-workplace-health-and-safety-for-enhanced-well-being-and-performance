Evaluating the success of workplace health and safety initiatives is essential to ensure ongoing improvement and the well-being of employees. In this chapter, we will explore various methods and metrics for effectively measuring workplace health and safety success.

1. **Incident Rate**
--------------------

* **Formula:** (Number of incidents / Total hours worked) x 100
* **Purpose:** Measures the frequency of accidents and injuries relative to the total work hours, providing an overview of safety performance.

2. **Severity Rate**
--------------------

* **Formula:** (Number of lost workdays due to incidents / Total hours worked) x 1000
* **Purpose:** Quantifies the severity of incidents by considering the lost workdays they cause.

3. **Near Miss Reporting**
--------------------------

* **Frequency:** Monitoring the number of reported near misses indicates proactive hazard identification and awareness.

4. **Safety Compliance**
------------------------

* **Audit Results:** Regular safety audits and inspections can assess compliance with safety policies and procedures.

7. **Safety Suggestion Box**
----------------------------

* **Engagement:** Evaluate the number and quality of safety suggestions submitted by employees.

8. **Lost-Time Injury Frequency**
---------------------------------

* **Formula:** (Number of lost-time injuries / Total hours worked) x 200,000
* **Purpose:** Measures the frequency of injuries that result in lost workdays per 200,000 hours worked.

9. **Return on Investment (ROI)**
---------------------------------

* **Formula:** (Value of injury prevention - Cost of safety program) / Cost of safety program
* **Purpose:** Calculates the financial return from investing in safety programs.
